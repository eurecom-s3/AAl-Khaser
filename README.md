# AAl-Khaser - Android Al-Khaser

This repository describes all Android evasive techniques categories. We were inspired by [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), an executable for the Windows OS developed for the same purpose.

The [documentation](./Documentation/evasive.pdf) contains a high-level per-purpose description along with the implementation details.

Moreover, this repo contains a proof-of-concept Android [app](./AntiAnalysisProofSample) that implements most of the evasive techniques.
