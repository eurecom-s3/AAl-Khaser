# AAl-Khaser - Android Al-Khaser

The purpose of this repository is to collect all well-known Android evasive techniques. 

The [documentation](./Documentation/evasive.pdf) contains a high-level per-purpose description along with the implementation details.

Moreover, this repo contains a proof-of-concept [Android app](./AntiAnalysisProofSample) that implements such evasive techniques.

We were inspired by [Al-Khaser](https://github.com/LordNoteworthy/al-khaser), an executable for the Windows OS developed for the same purpose.
